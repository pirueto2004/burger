# Delicious Burger App
This is a Full-Stack Model-View-Controller Application built with MySQL, Node.js, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM, and deployed on Heroku. The app allows you to add burgers to the menu (Database), view a list of burgers available to eat (GET), devour burgers (PUT), and throw them away (DELETE) after devoured.
